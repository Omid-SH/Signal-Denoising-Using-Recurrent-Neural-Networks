# Signal Denoising Using RNN and LSTM

In this notebook, we are going to test RNN and LSTM networks for testing different noisy signals such as :

*  1D signals (***Sinusoidal, Triangular, and Sawtooth***) with stationary and non-stationary Gaussian noise and uniform noise

*  2D curves (***Circular, Epitrochoid, and Nephroid***) with stationary and non-stationary Gaussian noise and uniform noise

*  Noisy music

*  Noisy grayscale image

*  Noisy 3 channel image
